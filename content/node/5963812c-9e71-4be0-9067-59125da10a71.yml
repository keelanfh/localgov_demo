      value: "<p class=\"callout callout-primary\">Apply for a Blue Badge on GOV.UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's free to apply. If&nbsp;your application is successful you'll be charged a Â£10 admin fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"alert alert-danger\">Do not use unofficial sites which charge a fee for applying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's quicker and easier to apply online, but paper forms are available. Please email or call Travel Services to request a paper form.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:travel.service@croydon.gov.uk\">travel.service@croydon.gov.uk</a></li>\r\n\t<li>020 8726 7100 x 62111</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Croydon Council will process the application and carry out any assessments needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Application processing times depend on individual circumstances, but can take 16 weeks or more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Assessments for a Blue Badge</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're unsure if you can get a Blue Bage,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge\">use the eligibility check on GOV.UK</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new.croydon.gov.uk/adult-health-and-social-care/travel-passes-and-support/blue-badges/eligibility\">read the eligibility criteria</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eligibility criteria for Blue Badges was expanded on 30 August 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is to ensure that people with hidden disabilities, such as mental health disorders, can access the Blue Badge scheme fairly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will now also qualify for a Blue Badge automatically if you have been awarded Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and have specifically scored 10 points in the section \"Planning and following a journey\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your points must have been awarded because you are unable to undertake any journey because of&nbsp;the overwhelming psychological distress (Descriptor E) it would cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not meeting any of the automatic criteria, you can still apply. Your application will be assessed by a Blue Badge eligibility assessor. They may contact you by telephone, or invite you for a face to face assessment to discuss your application further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Appeals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Blue Badge application is unsuccessful, you can&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"11d66177-b6c6-491b-8c89-c1fd9fb421e1\" href=\"https://new.croydon.gov.uk/adult-health-and-social-care/policies-and-complaints/concessionary-travel-service-appeals-policy\">appeal the decision</a>.</p>\r\n"
