      value: "<p class=\"alert alert-info\">There may be some changes to services to ensure the latest public health guidance is followed, and residents should check the council website for further information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Education</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Schools are closed and have moved teaching online until at least February half-term under a new national lockdown announced by the Prime Minister on Monday evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new national restrictions mean that there are extra rules in place, in addition to the Tier 4 regulations which already applied. This means that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Colleges, primary and secondary schools will remain open only for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. All other children will learn remotely until February half term. Please get in touch with your school directly if your child is going to struggle to access remote learning due to lack of technology or other issues.</li>\r\n\t<li>Early years settings (childminders, nurseries) remain open.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Your child’s school will be in touch with you to make arrangements if your child is entitled to free school meals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Follow the guidance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You must only leave your house for a few specific reasons (to exercise, shop for food, get essential medical help, if you absolutely cannot work at home or if your safety is threatened).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please remember that infection rates are very high, but we can reduce them by strictly following the restrictions and by hand-washing and wearing face coverings. Let's all continue to work together to save lives and protect the NHS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you get even mild symptoms, arrange a test and self-isolate for 10 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination against the virus is continuing and the NHS is asking everyone to be patient. You will be contacted when it's your turn to get the jab, you do not need to contact your GP - they will contact you. Further information about the vaccination is available on the NHS website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Help is here</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cumbria County Council can provide urgent help and emergency support, including basic food and essential items, or if you are struggling to cope with your current situation for whatever reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Call the county council's Support Helpline on 0800 783 1966 (Monday to Thursday 9am to 5pm, Friday 9am to 4.30pm). Our supportive staff will talk to you and suggest ways to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also email&nbsp;COVID19support@council.gov.uk&nbsp;and you will receive a response within one working day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Support for businesses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out if your business has been affected by the latest restrictions, and what support you may be entitled to, visit the government website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://track.vuelio.uk.com/z.z?l=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292LnVrL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2J1c2luZXNzLXN1cHBvcnQ%3d&amp;r=13120032051&amp;d=13052235&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;h=1dfedf4c09d673179813143e49ab6fed\" title=\"http://track.vuelio.uk.com/z.z?l=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ292LnVrL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2J1c2luZXNzLXN1cHBvcnQ%3d&amp;r=13120032051&amp;d=13052235&amp;p=1&amp;t=h&amp;h=1dfedf4c09d673179813143e49ab6fed\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cumbria County Council services update:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Household Waste and Recycling Centres</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Household Waste Recycling Centres are open, and we have no plans for closures during the new lockdown restrictions. There is a booking system in place at certain sites, and all sites are following social distancing guidelines. Please only visit if absolutely necessary, and make use of your local district council kerbside collection services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Libraries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with government guidance, libraries and archives will no longer be open for public browsing. Cumbria Libraries will continue to offer essential services such as click and collect and home delivery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ceremonies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government guidance is that weddings and civil partnerships should only take place in exceptional circumstances, for example, an urgent marriage where one of those getting married is seriously ill and not expected to recover, or is to undergo debilitating treatment or life-changing surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where ceremonies do go ahead, a maximum of six people are allowed to be present, not including staff working at the event. Our teams are on hand to speak to customers to advise them of the latest advice and discuss alternative arrangements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visiting a Cumbria Care Home</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Council Care remains open for pre-booked visits to specific visitor rooms in each home which are purposefully designed to allow social distance visiting safely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cllr Sally Cinnamon, Cabinet Member for Public Health and Communities, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>“I am pleased that the council is able to continue providing essential services to residents, and I know that the current lockdown measures are affecting everyone’s daily lives. It is vital that we all continue to follow the guidance, keep our distance, wash hands and wear face coverings in public. I also want people to know that help and support is available, and urge anyone who needs it to contact the council’s Covid support line. I’d also like to thank all of the wonderful community groups and volunteers who give up their time to support others during these challenging times.”</blockquote>\r\n"
